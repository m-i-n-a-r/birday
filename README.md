## Introduction
This is an open source app to remember **birthdays** in a fast, light and beautiful way. No less, no more. I had this idea considering that Google Calendar doesn't display an automatic notification the day of the birthday, and sometimes i need to remember a birthday for a person who is not in my Contacts. Also, adding too much birthdays to the calendar makes it messy and i prefer to manage them separately. The main focus of this app is being easy to use, clean and lightweight. I'm always glad to add features, but only important and really useful features!

There is also a long term support version available, ready to be compiled and used when this repo is messed up by my partial updates. I'm planning to create a separate branch for development and keep the master branch clean and working, but that's a good solution too. Huge thanks to @DominikNovosel for the constant help in the maintenance of this project :) https://github.com/DominikNovosel/Birday-LTS
